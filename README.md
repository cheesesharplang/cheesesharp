# Cheese# #
Designed for big-boy programming.  
[The language syntax is to be decided. Help would be appreciated.](https://github.com/cheesesharplang/cheesesharp/issues/1)

## Planned Features

 - [ ] Implement an x86 FASM visitor.
 - [ ] Implement a visitor for another CPU (name unknown).
 - [ ] [Implement the escape character.](https://github.com/cheesesharplang/cheesesharp/issues/2)

## Why yet another programming language?
Because they all suck!
Cheese# has elegance, power, and readability all in one package!
Countless drivers shall use Cheese#.
Entire web servers, architectures will be built upon Cheese#.
It has a very sophisticated architecture, which is sure to attract the likes of ~~Torvalds~~ any C-guru.
Unlike Java, C++, he'll say "Yes, Cheese# shall now be used in the Linux kernel".  
Every member in the C Standard Commitee shall move to Cheese#.
Windows shall be more of an abomination, as it will now be comprised of both Cheese# and C.

Cheese# is the C killer.
